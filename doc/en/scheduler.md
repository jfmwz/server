#Card scheduler specification

The heart of every SRS is a scheduler. It decides when should be the next repetition of
a card, in which order new cards should be displayed and so on.

##Glossary

* Old card - a card that has at least one mark.
* New card - a card that doesn't have even one mark.
* Good card - an old card that has 4 or 5 as a last mark.
* Bad card - an old card that has 1, 2 or 3 as a last mark.
* Repetition point - a timestamp that marks a point in time, when the card should be reviewed to get most out of
spacing effect.
* Ready card - an old card with its repetition point in the past.

##Requrements
There are 3 main lists of cards for a review.

* A list of ready cards. (Good and remembered cards)
* A list of bad cards. (Forgotten or not yet remembered cards)
* A list of new cards.

There should be 2 levels of schedulers.

* Three level-2 schedulers that govern three lists of new cards (SNew, SBad, SRdy)
* One level-1 scheduler that combines lists from lvl-2 schedulers to generate a list of cards for users.

##Level-2 schedulers

There are three lvl-2 schedulers. Schedulers for bad cards and ready cards are very simple,
but scheduler for new cards should take tag priorities and limits into account for constructing own list.

###Ready card scheduler

This scheduler constructs list of ready cards. Most of the time it should just order cards by repetition point,
but in case of user not reviewing cards for some days, scheduler should give some bias to cards that are near repetition
point too.

###Bad card scheduler

This scheduler constructs list of cards which had last mark 1, 2 or 3. User should have reviewed that card some time
away, to create some spaces even beetween bad repetitions.

###New card scheduler

This scheduler constructs a list of new cards. Cards are being prioritized by their tags as maximum priority of 
a tag that belong to card's word. Priorities come with limits, for example there shouldn't be more than
X cards with certain tag within a some time period.

Priorities by themself shouldn't be determenistic as ordering. If a card has a higher priority than another should mean
higher probability of that card appearing in a list.

##Level-1 scheduler

High-level scheduler should take output of low-level schedulers and create a single list of cards which contains
cards that will be presented to a user for a review in order they appear in the list. Main responsibility of this
scheduler will be a maintenance of a best possible form of the global card repetition forecast for a user.

Here is an example of such forecast.
![Learning forecast example](http://i.imgur.com/jKT0btP.png)

On 0 there are number of cards that have repetition points in 24 hours from now, 1 - from 24 to 48 hours, etc.
Graph can be divided in 2 areas that conform to one of two types of old cards in a learning process.

1. A certain ammount of bad cards or fresh good cards that aren't scheduled after a long spacing interval. Young cards.
2. An almost constant stream of good cards that were scheduled after pretty long spacing interval. Mature cards.

Cards become mature after a chain of repetitions with good marks.
